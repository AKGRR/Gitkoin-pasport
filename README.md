### ENS GATED COMMUNITIES

We set up a goal of enabling any user of sismo to get a free ens ens subdomain `user.sismo.eth` while simustanously giving them a common NFT so that only `***.sismo.eth` name holders could join our discord.

This repository is the result of our exploration of all parts of the ENS smart contracts as well as its npm library `ensjs`

We open-source it: 
  - For teams: any team could use this codebase to offer the same ENS Gate for their community. 
  - For Devs
    - `ENSDeployer.sol` enables you to deploy locally ENS with latest contracts (such as NameWrapper) and with a simplified EthRegistrar (no need to go through the 2-phase registration process)
    - `ens.spec.ts` was created as a tutorial to discover all features of the ENS system (contracts and `ensjs` lib)

We hope that you will enjoy it!

If you want to deploy this for your community, please join our discord: sismo.io
